# ssh-multi

A trivial reimplementation of [tmux-multi](https://github.com/sysadminjohn/tmux-multi) that doesn't use tmux but just terminal tabs to spawn N ssh connections to N hosts in different terminal tabs. Netcat is also supported for troubleshooting purposes.

For extra comfort, a script is also provided to automatically add the alias and be able to invoke the command with `ssh-multi` from any path.


## TODO

- TODO itself is yet to be written but the code surely has room for improvement
